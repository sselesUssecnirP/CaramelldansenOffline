# CaramelldansenOffline
Don't ask why I made it, but it's a simple offline app to listen to Caramelldansen with flashing rainbow lights.

As of right now, there is no way to turn off rainbow lights. If, for whatever reason, people find this and want to be able to turn it off... I'll post an update. I highly doubt anyone will find this. Let alone use it! 

I hope you enjoy it if you do use it! :3
